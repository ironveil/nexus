title: "Conservative Domination"
date: "1951 - 1964"

There are a variety of factors that resulted in the Conservatives staying in power for 13 years:

<h3 id="living-standards">Wages & Living Standards</h3>

Living standards rose significantly in the 1950's as Britain recovered from WW2 & the Korean War. A combination of wages rising faster than prices & a decrease in income tax just before elections increased consumer purchasing power, which allowed people to spend more money & splash out on more luxurious things. For example, car ownership rose 500%, the number of people owning labour-reducing machines *(like fridges & washing machines)* rose significantly & the number of people owning TVs rose from 4% to 91%.

<br />

[MacMillan](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-leaders#macmillan) famously said that *"most people never had it so good"* in 1957 & claimed that *"live is better under the Conservatives"*.

### Credit
The government made it easier for people to borrow money through credit. This allowed people to splash out more on things they wouldn't usually, like holidays.

### Housing
The Conservatives reached their [election](/history/britain/51-election) promise of 300,000 new homes a year by 1954 & overall built 1.7 million new homes. This, combined with the higher purchasing power, helped rapidly increase the number of people owning their own properties & decreased the waiting list for getting a home. They also removed controls & limits on rent, which allowed many more people to rent properties. However, this also helped raise rent for some.

<h3 id="economy">Economic Policies</h3>

At the time, both the Conservatives & Labour had similar economic policies - which was named Butskellism. They wanted higher funding for the welfare state, a strong industry & full employment. However, the Conservatives implemented stop-go economic policies - where the government would switch between stimulating & restricting the economy. This was an alternative to developing an economic strategy to have consistent growth. If spending & wages rose rapidly, taxes & interest rates would increase, and import controls would be introduced. If spending was reduced, then taxes & interest rates fell, and import controls would be relaxed. However, it failed for several reasons:

- Stagflation happened - where industrial output dropped but inflation stayed the same.
- There was an increase in imports & exports were reduced due to British goods becoming too expensive to manufacture.
- Policies based on stop-go were unstable & hindered growth as it prevented building a strong economic base.
- The government failed to invest in key industries - like textiles & shipbuilding - and failed to invest in industrial research & development, which hindered growth.
- Despite [MacMillan's](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-leaders#macmillan) claims, unemployment still steadily rose:
    - 370k unemployed in 1951,
    - 300k unemployed in 1956,
    - 880k unemployed in 1963.

<h2 id="social">Social Policies</h2>
After WW2, there was a massive societal shift. People of different classes fought alongside each other during the war & women worked traditionally 'male' jobs. The blur of class distinctions was helped by the welfare state - since people were better off, more people owned houses & the gap between the working and middle classes shrunk.

<br />

The Conservatives replaced the old three-tier education system with the comprehensive system. The old system featured an '11 Plus' exam to determine what type of school a child should go to: a grammar school for those more academically-inclined, a secondary-technical for those more technically-minded, and a secondary-modern for people who didn't fit in either. This was replaced by a new system, which abolished the '11 Plus' & made people attend schools in their local catchment area. This would increase competitiveness between local schools & boost their quality of education, as well as allowing everyone an equal access to knowledge & education.
