title: "1964 General Election"
date: "1964-10-15"

An election was called in 1964, which led to the victory of Labour & the end of the 13 years of [Conservative domination](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives). However, what was apparent that this was due to a rejection of the Conservatives, rather than an endorsement of Labour.

### Harold Wilson's Leadership
After Gaitskell died in 1963, Harold Wilson was elected leader. He managed to gloss over any internal divisions & portrayed Labour as *'modern, progressive & dynamic'*. This was also alongside a new election manifesto that offered full employment, economic growth, and increased welfare, healthcare and housing. He was also seen as a classless professional due to his more humble background - a man of the people to lead a new scientific & advanced Britain. However, this was not reflected in the polls - Labour received 10,000 less votes than the 1959 election.

### Public Perception of the Conservatives
The Conservatives were blamed for the [economic issues](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-domination#economy) & failed to tackle rising unemployment, inflation, class gap & industrial worries. They were also out of touch due to the various scandals & the Earl of Home being their leader - people saw them as old-fashioned, elite & self-righteous.

### Liberal Revival
Many people disliked the Conservatives, but couldn't bring themselves to vote Labour. Therefore, the Liberals gained twice as many votes compared to 1959, and increased their seats from 9 to 12. Most of these votes were stolen from the Conservatives, which allowed Labour to have the majority and win the election.

<br />

The gain in voters was also due to more publicity, funding & new people. This meant they could contest more seats than before, thus being an option for more people. Previously, they didn't have the money or support to contest many seats - however this had changed due to the decline of the Conservatives.

A rise in living standards allowed people to have more money & be more independent, therefore being less likely to accept traditional values & opt for more progressive values instead. This often led to many youth riots. Underprivileged youth also had better access to education, which led to a blur of the class divide. These youth also wanted a classless, scientific & technologically advanced society, which Labour promised them.
