<h2 id="reforms">Reforms & Conflicts</h2>

Wilson started his transformation through new reforms, which was a big part of his election campaign due to the [changes in society](/history/britain/64-election#society). This was led by the progressive Liberal Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, who imposed many pieces of legislation which 'modernised society':

- **Nov 1965**: the Murder act temporarily abolished the death penalty, which most people disliked *(it was fully outlawed in 1969)*.
- **Nov 1965**: the Race Relations act made discrimination in public facilities illegal, however it was still legal in private.
- **June 1967**: the Family Planning act made contraception accessible to all on the NHS, not just married couples. This led to a decline in both birth rates & unwanted pregnancies.
- **July 1967**: the Sexual Offences act made homosexual acts in private between consenting adults legal.
- **Apr 1968**: the Race Relations act made discrimination in housing and employment illegal.
- **July 1968**: the Theatres act ended the censorship of plays by the Lord Chamberlain.
- **May 1968**: the Voting act lowered the voting age from 21 to 18.
- **Oct 1969**: the Divorce act made the process simpler & cheaper, which allowed more people to escape abusive marriages.
- **May 1970**: the Equal Pay act made men and women receive the same pay for the same work.

### Race Relations
During the 1960's & 70's, there was a lot of racial tension. Britain had a large stream of immigrants from more impoverished countries. These immigrants settled for low-paying jobs, which allowed employers to reduce wages for these jobs that were typically taken up by Labour's target demographic. People also believed that "white Britain was under siege" due to the large number of immigrants. This led to the famous racist "rivers of blood" speech by Enoch Powell on the 20th of April 1968, where he claimed that *"immigration would be the end of Britain"*. This caused mass protest on both sides - with many supporting the speech & many hating it. This helped increase racial tension & made Wilson very paranoid.

### Education Reform
Many people disliked the current three-tier system, so the Minister for Education Anthony Crossland started replacing the old system with the new comprehensive system. He also helped expand Universities across Britain due to the Robbins report, which claimed that Britain needed a sufficiently educated population. Wilson also established the Open University, which allowed people to work on a degree part-time & at home. However these reforms were actually started during the [Conservatives](/history/britain/51-4-conservatives-domination#social). Douglas-Home began to implement these during his short leadership.

### Cabinet Management
To try and stabilise his cabinet, Wilson decided to give minister jobs to senior figures of all shades of opinions, rather than just picking his friends & colleagues. However, this resulted in bitter arguments & clashes of personality. This fighting reached a peak in 1969 when trying to deal with [industrial relations](/history/britain/64-70-labour-economy#industrial-relations). Despite this, only 4 cabinet members resigned *(the same number that resigned under [MacMillan](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-leaders#macmillan))*.

## Foreign Issues
A lot of foreign & colonial issues arose under Wilson.

<h3 id="vietnam-war">Vietnam War</h3>

The UK relied heavily on the US for financial aid, especially after the [post-war financial crisis](/history/britain/45-51-labour#financial-crisis). Those on the left of the Labour party thought that the US was aggressive and imperialist, and wanted Wilson to criticise their efforts in the Vietnam War. However, Wilson knew that this would damage their relationship with the US, so he showed public support for the war effort - however, he reused President Johnson's urges for Britain to send troops. He also criticised the heavy bombing of Vietnam in 1966, and tried to establish a peace deal in 1967. However, these efforts still annoyed the US, and the left weren't satisfied with Wilson's efforts.

### Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe)
After the war, the British Empire started a process of decolonisation, where many of it's colonies became independent and ruled by the majority of that country. In 1965, Ian Smith declared an independent Southern Rhodesia by the white-minority government, which would have prevented the government being ran by the black-majority through decolonisation.

The left wanted Wilson to send troops to crush the rebellion, however Wilson initially opted for economic sanctions. These failed, and instead he tried personal diplomacy - Smith was allowed to rule as long as majority rule was introduced. Smith's refusal of this made people believe that Wilson was against the rebellion, which helped public support of Wilson. The situation wasn't solved until the establishment of an independent Zimbabwe in 1980.

### EEC Rejection
Wilson believed that he could persuade the French President De Gaulle to change his mind after his [previous veto](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-decline#eec). This failed, and the answer in 1967 was still no. However, this rejection helped improve party unity as the pro-Europeans were pleased by the application & anti-Europeans by it's rejection.
