## Churchill
By 1951, Churchill was an old man. He was just a figurehead for the government, and his vote was more of a 'thank you' for WW2. As a result, his Chancellor R. A. Butler ran the country for him. He had been responsible for reforming the Conservatives after the failure of the 1945 election, which led to the success in [1951 election](/history/britain/51-election).

## Eden
Churchill resigned in 1955 & was replaced by Antony Eden. To help strengthen the Conservatives, he called an election immediately after taking office, which increased the Conservative majority. This was due to his personal appeal - he attracted many women voters due to him being attractive & well-dressed.

<h3 id="suez">Suez Crisis</h3>
On the 26th of July 1956, Nasser *(president of Egypt)* suddenly announced that the Suez canal would be nationalised & owned by Egypt. This made Britain & France furious as previously they had owned the canal. Therefore, secret meetings between the two nations were held & they devised a plan - Israel was to invade Egypt, and Britain & France were to act as peacemakers to try and restore their control of the Suez region. The plan was a military success. However, there were many public protests against the war, and there were mass military desertions. Also, both the US & USSR joined forces at the UN & called for an end of the invasion. Britain were forced to retreat; they had also lost access to oil in the region & US aid. As a result, Eden resigned.

<h2 id="macmillan">MacMillan</h2>

Harold MacMillan replaced Eden's short reign. Initially, he was successful - the [high living standards](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-domination#living-standards) continued & people lived comfortably. As a result, the Conservatives increased their majority again in the 1959 election. To appear more progressive, they also supported a change in values like the abolishment of the death penalty & dismantle of the Empire.

<br />

By the turn of the 1960's, the economic issues of stop-go economics started to appear, which contributed to their eventual decline. To try and fix this, MacMillan reshuffled his cabinet in what was known as the 'Night of the Long Knives' in July 1962. 7 out of the 20 members of the cabinet were replaced, due to MacMillan being scared by Labour & Liberal successes in by-elections & opinion polls. However, this tanked his popularity, as people saw it as stabbing his friends & colleagues in the back. He also tried to join the successful EEC, but this failed. Several scandals started to surface too, which made the public very critical of the government & MacMillan. Due to his declining popularity, he resigned in 1963.

## Douglas-Home
Alec Douglas-Home was popular within the Conservatives & was backed by MacMillan. As a result, the party elected him as leader & he became Prime Minister. However, this method of only allowing the inner Conservative party members to vote in the new Prime Minister was controversial to the public, and showed that they were out of touch. This was reflected in the 1964 election, where they lost to the reformed Labour party under Harold Wilson.
