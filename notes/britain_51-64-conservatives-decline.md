title: "Conservative Decline"
date: "1951 - 1964"

During the Conservative's 13 years in power, their public support massively declined.

## Economic Issues

By the 1960's, the issues with [stop-go economics](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-domination#economy) were starting to show. The main issue was a large balance of payments deficit - where Britain was importing more than they were exporting. This was due to several factors:

- Due to the lack of investment in British industries, British goods were expensive to manufacture & often very poor quality. As a result, they were unpopular to export & Britons preferred better-quality foreign goods.
- People missed out on buying luxuries during WW2 & post-war rationing. Once it ended, and people started earning more, there was a massive influx in luxury items being bought. Most of these were foreign-made.

Any attempts to fix this was ineffective. They tried to pause pay in the public sector, but this didn't slow the amount of imports. A National Economic Development Council *(NEDC)* was set up, which included representatives from the government, trade unions & industrial managers. They failed to come up with a successful strategy to deal with the deficit. A National Incomes Committee *(NIC)* was set up to try and control incomes, which would help deal with the number of imports & inflation. However, this didn't work.

<br />

Unemployment also skyrocketed, despite [MacMillan's](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-leaders#macmillan) claims - there were 800,000 unemployed people by the end of 1963, with the North & Scotland being badly affected. Those that did work also were on strike, most notably in the docks. This badly affected the economy as they controlled imports & exports, and this is severely limited when a strike is happening.

<h3 id="eec">EEC Rejection</h3>

Several European nations had set up a European Economic Committee *(EEC)* to establish a common trade area & helped promote friendly relations. Compared to Britain, the EEC countries were doing much better economically. Britain also was no longer a world power - this was evident through the [Suez Crisis](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-leaders#suez) & the collapse of the Empire. However, De Gaulle vetoed the the application, stating that Britain focused too much on the Commonwealth countries *(like New Zealand, Australia & Canada)* and America, rather than European interests.

## Scandals

There were several scandals that weakened MacMillan's support, and helped contribute to their decline.

### Vassal Affair

John Vassal was a civil servant in the Admiralty who spied for the Soviet Union. Rumours suggested that he was protected by senior members, however there was no evidence. This created public distrust towards the civil servants & Admiralty, and showed that there were spies within the government.

### Philby Case

Kim Philby was a senior official at the Foreign Office, and had been passing information to the Soviet Union & recruiting spies for them. He had successfully fled to Russia in 1963. This showed that the Secret Service weren't doing their jobs properly, especially since more spies were recruited & he got away safely.

### Argyll Divorce

In 1963, the Duke of Argyll sued his (ex)-wife for adultery. She allegedly slept with 88 people, and had engaged in group sex. Some of these people were rumoured to be government ministers, as well as important British & American figures. This created distrust towards MPs, as they engaged in acts that the public disliked in their private lives.

## Social Issues

After WW2, class barriers began to break down and the Conservatives had helped this through their [education reforms](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-domination#social). However, WW2 resulted in many working-class men dying in the battlefields, so the [post-war Labour government](/history/britain/45-51-labour) introduced the British Nationality Act in 1948. This allowed any citizen of a Commonwealth country to hold a British passport & come work in the UK. This caused a mass influx of immigrants from all over the old British Empire, especially after the violent partition of India & the Cyprus civil war.

### Race Riots

However, many Britons disliked this influx of immigrants and struggled to adapt to a multiracial society. Immigrants were blamed for housing shortages, simply because they were occupying houses where rent was cheap. They were also blamed for the job shortages, since they often accepted jobs with lower pay than average. Tensions spilled in 1958-59 & riots emerged in many parts of the countries including London, Bristol & Nottingham. Notting Hill was a notable example - youths attacked properties owned by black people. Police struggled to contain these riots, but gave out harsh sentences to those that were caught.

<br />

The government tried to help by launching the Salmon Inquiry. This deduced that the riots were due to an increase in immigration, and failed to mention the discrimination immigrants faced when looking for housing or employment. The government also introduced the 1962 Commonwealth Immigration Act, which introduced quota immigration limits from each Commonwealth country. However, this created a rush of immigrants that wanted to avoid the restrictions, which made the situation worse.

### Youth Riots

During the 1950's & 1960's, a youth culture formed that had interests & beliefs that opposed their elders, and often caused violence between the different sub-cultures. One reason for all this was due to a rise in [affluence](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-domination#living-standards), since the youth could afford new things like transistor radios - however, not everyone could and this resulted in an increase in antisocial behaviour. Another reason was due to the fact that they never grew up with the horrors of war, so they didn't feel attracted to strict hierarchical structures and authority. The various scandals of the Conservatives helped add to this, as well as the link between the Conservatives & traditional values. This culminated with the release of several satirical political pieces like 'Private Eye' & 'That Was The Week That Was', and the rise of new entertainment like Rock 'n Roll music.
