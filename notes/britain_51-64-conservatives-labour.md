During the 1950's, Labour became a very weak party, for a variety of factors:

### Leadership & Political Stance

A divide formed in the Labour party after they lost the [1951 election](/history/britain/51-election). There were those on the left of the party like Aneurin Bevan, who were known as the fundamentalists. They thought that the Welfare State was the first step towards a fully Socialist Britain, that union leaders should have a say in parliamentary policies, and wanted to nationalise more services through Clause IV *(the Labour policy that focuses on nationalising key services)*.

<br />

There were also those on the right of the party like Hugh Gaitskell, who were known as the revisionists. They wanted to modernise the Labour party & wanted to focus more on social equality than economic change, abolish Clause IV, and wanted people in parliament make policies rather than union leaders. This divide was widened when Gaitskell became the Labour party leader after Attlee retired in 1955.

### Nuclear Policy

There was also a divide on nuclear bombs. The revisionists wanted to maintain Britain's nuclear deterrence & for West Germany to enter NATO. However, the fundamentalists wanted nuclear disarmament instead. They argued that the money was better spent on welfare programs & they didn't want the Soviet Union to fall behind in the arms race. They also didn't want West Germany to join NATO as they feared that it would isolate & scare away the Soviet Union.

### Economic Manipulation

The 1959 election was won by [MacMillan](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-leaders#macmillan), however Gaitskell had a chance to win. The [Suez crisis](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-leaders#suez) was still in the minds of the voters, and people were starting to become aware of the economic manipulation by the Conservatives through their pre-election budgets. They would release 'give-away' budgets in the run-up to the election, which would lower taxes & promote economic recovery; this would increase their voters & give power to MacMillan's claim that *"life is better under the Conservatives"*. Post-election, they would send out a more controversial budget, which would increase taxes & recoup their lost cash in the 'give-away' budget.

<br />

However, a 'give-away' budget helped win the election & was still enough to sway voters. Also, Labour's budget ideas were unrealistic - they wanted to increase old-age pensions without an increase in tax. People started asking how they would fund it, to which Labour gave unconvincing arguments & solutions. They were also against joining the EEC *(something which the Conservatives were [trying to do](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-decline#eec) & was popular with the voters)*, which damaged their 'modern & progressive' reputation.
