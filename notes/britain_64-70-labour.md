While Labour did win the [1964 election](/history/britain/64-election), Wilson gained a lot of issues:

- They only had a majority of 4, which is very difficult to work with.
- During the election, they had set high expectations with modernising Britain.
- There were a lot of foreign & colonial issues to deal with.
- The Labour party was still somewhat [divided](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-labour), with several talented & senior leaders disliking each other.
- Wilson had inherited a [very bad economy](/history/britain/51-64-conservatives-domination#economy), with issues he needed to fix.

However, Wilson believed & was a good leader. He came from a humble background, which people trusted, and had always been good & interested in politics. He was intelligent, hard-working & had good memory. He also sought compromise rather than conflict, and was open to both sides of the party.

### 1966 Election

A majority of 4 was unworkable, so Wilson called a snap election - he massively increased his majority to 96. People still blamed the Conservatives for the poor economy, and Wilson made their new leader, Edward Heath, look dogged & ponderous.

## Wilson's Transformations

As part of their 1964 election manifesto, Labour had promised voters that they would reform society 'in the white heat of technology'.
