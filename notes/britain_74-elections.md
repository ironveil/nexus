## February 1974 Election
Heath called an election, hoping that he would have decisive support for his government policies. However, this resulted in an indecisive election - the electorate couldn't decide which party to vote for. The Conservatives got 11.8 million votes & 297 seats, and Labour got 11.6 million votes & 301 seats. Heath tried to form an anti-Labour coalition, but failed. Therefore, Wilson won but with a hung parliament - he didn't have a full majority so he would struggle to pass any laws or bills.

Since he had a minority government, Wilson decided to call another election in October. Labour managed to increase their seats to 319 & gain a majority of 3, however this clearly wasn't an endorsement of Labour. They managed to still win, despite their [previous failures](/history/britain/64-70-labour) for several reasons:

<h3 id="unions">Trade Unions</h3>

To show that the Industrial Relations Act was unnecessary, Wilson reached an agreement with the TUC in 1973 called the Social Contract:

- The Unions agreed to co-operate in trying to control wage increases.
- The government promised to try to keep down prices & provide better welfare benefits.
- There would be a return to free collective bargaining over wages & no statutory incomes policy.

However, the wage increases still was above the inflation rate & it gave the Unions a lot of power - the leader of the Transport Workers Union was rated the most powerful man in Britain. However, the Social Contract did suggest that the Unions & government had shared goals, and that they could co-operate. This contract lasted until the [winter of discontent](/history/britain/74-79-labour#winter-of-discontent) in 1978/9.

### Drift to the Left
Many people thought that the Labour party had [drifted to the right](/history/britain/70-election#labour-split) last time they were in power. To solve this, they had drifted back to the left during their time in the opposition. This was reflected in the appointment of two cabinet ministers:

- **Michael Foot**: he was appointed at the Department of Employment. He believed in strong social equality, and took over Callaghan from 1980 - 1983.
- **Tony Benn**: he was appointed as the secretery of state for industry. He was a strong socialist & anti-Nuclear weapons, and served under Wilson's previous cabinet.

While this shift to the left did happen throughout the party, as well as at the local level, it did cause problems during the 1980s.

### Divisions over Europe
Labour promised to renegotiate the terms for the [British entry into the EEC](/history/britain/70-74-conservatives#eec) & to hold a referendum on the issue. The entry terms were reduced so that Britain had to pay less to the EEC budget, and a date for the referendum was set in 1975. Wilson allowed his ministers to campaign for either side, which resulted in a 2:1 vote in favour of joining the EEC. This was proposed as a way to fix Britain's economic issues, and the issue of Europe & Labour divisions were hidden again.
