### Wilson's Resignation
In March 1976, Wilson decided to resign. This came as a shock to many, as he was only 60 years old. However, his usually excellent memory was failing him, and it was later revealed that after the [1974 election](/history/britain/74-elections) he only planned to serve for two years. He was replaced by his Chancellor James Callaghan.

## Economic Difficulties
Labour took on the role of trying to solve the disputes with the Trade Unions. They had settled the [Miners strike](/history/britain/70-74-conservatives#oil) with a 29% pay rise, but this worsened the issue of wages rising faster than growth. Inflation reached 30% by 1975, which made the Trade Unions demand more pay rises. This was worsened also by a world recession hitting British exports, with little economic growth & unemployment rising from ~550,000 in 1974 to over 1,300,000 two years later.

In an attempt to control inflation, the Chancellor Denis Healey imposed economic restrictions to try and recover the economy:

- The 1975 budget increased taxes & reduced government spending, to try and take money out of the economy to reduce prices.
- In July 1975, the government introduced a £6 per week pay rise limit, with higher wages having a pay freeze. Trade Unions reluctantly agreed, however some left-win MPs opposed the limit.
- A year later, the government reduced the pay rise limit to £4 per week. This successfully reduced pay increases:
    - Average 26% pay rise in 1975.
    - Average 15% pay rise in 1976.
    - Average 10% pay rise in 1977.


While this did help to ease inflation, there was no industrial recovery & growth. Exports were still expensive to produce & imports remained high, which led the balance of payments into deficit.

### The IMF Loan
During 1976, the Sterling fell massively in value as people lost confidence in it - this threatened to drive up the cost of British imports even more & make inflation worse. The Bank of England bought up lots of Sterling on foreign exchanges in order to inflate it's value, but they started to run out of the country's currency reserves.

<br />

In September 1976, Healey decided to ask the IMF for help. The IMF was an international fund set up post-war, that could give out loans on strict conditions. The IMF agreed to a £3900 million loan, but as long as Britain cut government spending by £2 billion per year. This was agreed on in December. While this did create a rift with the left of the party, it did help prevent a political & economic crisis.

### The Lib-Lab Pact
Wilson's small majority in the [October 1974 election](/history/britain/74-elections#october) disappeared through several by-elections. In March 1977, Callaghan made a deal with the leader of the Liberals, David Steele, that 13 Liberal MPs would support the Labour government & its policies.

The government's plans for the economy relied on the Trade Unions co-operating with their limits of pay rises. However, the Unions didn't like Healey's policies and felt that they had abandoned their [Social Contract](/history/britain/74-elections#unions). In response, Ford factory workers gained a 15% pay increase after a three-month strike. This was followed by a lorry worker strike in January 1979, demanding a 30% pay rise - this caused oil shortages & affected deliveries. More strikes & overtime bans were added through the national Union of Public Workers (NUPE), who represented the lowest-paid local authority workers & who wanted a 40% pay rise. Dustmen & gravediggers were involved in the strike, which led to rubbish piling up & the dead not being buried - this was dramatic & easy for the press to criticise the government on.

<br />

During all this, Callaghan was at a summit in the West Indies. When asked about the condition of Britain, he responded: "I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos". People thought that he was denying the current crisis, and was further evidence to how out of touch the government was.

## Vote of No Confidence
The government won the support of Plaid Cymru *(Wales)* & the SNP *(Scotland)* through promising to devolve some powers to their countries. However, a referendum in those countries failed to pass in March 1979, and devolution couldn't proceed. The nationalist MPs saw this as a failure of the government, and decided to join the Conservatives in a vote of no confidence against Callaghan. The government lost by a single vote, and an [election took place](/history/britain/79-election).
